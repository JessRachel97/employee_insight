The employee experienced fluctuations in their mental health throughout the feedback periods. Initially, they scored a 4 in late July due to feeling overwhelmed with caregiving duties and work pressure, which improved slightly to a consistent score of 5 during most of August and early September. By December, signs of improvement became evident with scores reaching 8, indicating substantial progress as the employee employed strategies like delegation, self-care, and time management to balance both work and personal life effectively, culminating in enhanced well-being and optimism for the new year. Their special beliefs evolved from a focus on stress management and seeking support to developing a growth mindset and resilience, reflecting their journey towards better mental health and professional growth.
