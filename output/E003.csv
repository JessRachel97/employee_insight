Over time, the employee's mental health appears to show an overall trend of improvement. Starting from a medium baseline score of 5 on July 29, 2024, their score fluctuated slightly but generally improved, peaking at 7 by the end of December. This progression aligns with their increasing adoption of mindfulness practices, improved sleep habits, and proactive engagement in stress management workshops. 

The employee's special beliefs also evolved throughout the feedback sessions; they shifted from a focus on stress management and mindfulness in July, to developing resilience and maintaining work-life balance by December. Their growing confidence through seeking mentorship and recognition indicates a strengthening belief in their valued contributions and a more optimistic outlook towards their work challenges.
