The employee's mental health state transitioned from feeling frustrated and overwhelmed due to physical limitations in late July (score of 4) to experiencing increased isolation and stress in early August (score of 3). As the months progressed, particularly in September, they began incorporating strategies that improved their well-being, leading to scores in the mid-range (5 to 7) until December. By late December, the employee noted a significant improvement in mental and emotional health, ending the year feeling optimistic and ready for new challenges. Their special beliefs also showed a positive evolution, starting with feelings of inadequacy and comparison stress, but shifting towards a stronger emphasis on resilience, growth mindset, and collaborative success by the year's end.
